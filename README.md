# Movie-Night
This app was created by Alex Martrain, J Seybold, Ryan Mcdaniel, Leah Krumholz, and Jessica Gonzalez.

## Description
We made a movie search app using the [Streaming Availability](https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability) API and the [Worldwide Recipes](https://rapidapi.com/ptwebsolution/api/worldwide-recipes1) API. Users can search movies based on title or genre then scroll through a results list to discover movies they may not have known about. Once the movie list is populated, they have an option to then search for recipes to enhance their movie night.
